# 👨‍💻 Hi! I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a Passion for Agile and Process Optimization 🚀

I specialize in **web technologies** 🌐 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Angular, Next.js, Tailwind CSS) and **database design** 🗄️ (MongoDB, Firebase, SQL Server). I also have experience in **mobile app development** 📱 using **Java** in **Android Studio**, and a solid foundation in **object-oriented programming (OOP)** 💻. My goal? To create **efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solutions** that make an impact and **address customer needs** 💡.

Before diving into software development, I worked for **4 years in the financial sector** 💰 as a **Financial Analyst and Process Engineer**. Here, I developed a strong understanding of **process optimization** 🔧 and became passionate about **Agile methodologies** 🔄, especially **Scrum**, **Lean**, and **Design Thinking**. I collaborated with **cross-functional teams** (Technology, UX, Operations, and Sales) to **map BPMN end-to-end flows**, improve operational workflows, and drive **data-driven decision-making** 📊. Tools like **Bizagi** and **Draw.io** were key to visualizing process improvements, while **Jira** and **Miro** helped manage projects efficiently.

With a background in **Industrial Engineering** 🛠️, I've built strong **analytical**, **communication**, and **collaboration skills**. I’m always eager to learn 📚, adapt, and bring my **technical expertise** and **business insights** to solve challenges in creative ways.
