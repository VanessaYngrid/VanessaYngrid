I am a software development student proficient in web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and database design with MongoDB and SQL server. I also have experience in mobile application development using Java in Android Studio, as well as a strong foundation in object-oriented programming with Java.

I have 4 years of experience in a financial institution as a financial analyst and process engineer, with a focus on process improvement through the use of agile methodologies such as Lean, Design Thinking, and OKR based on the Scrum framework as the working model, mapping end-to-end process flows using tools such as Bizagi and Drawi.io, creating metrics, applying agile Methodology, and using project collaboration tools such as Miro and Jira.

My previous bachelor's degree in industrial engineering and work experience were essential in developing my problem-solving and interpersonal skills through my analytical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills, as well as my ability to adapt to different challenges and become a versatile professional.
